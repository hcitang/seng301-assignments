    /**
    * Represents a standard configuration of the vending machine hardware:
    * 
    *   - one coin slot;
    *   - one coin receptacle (called the coin receptacle) to temporarily store
    * coins entered by the user;
    *   - one coin receptacle (called the storage bin) to store coins that have
    * been accepted as payment, but do not fit into the coin racks (i.e. if the
    * coin rack is full);
    *   - a set of one or more coin racks (the number and the denomination of coins
    * stored by each is specified in the constructor);
    *   - one delivery chute used to deliver pop cans and to return coins;
    *   - a set of one or more pop can racks (the number, cost, and pop name stored
    * in each is specified in the constructor);
    *   - one textual display;
    *   - a set of one or more selection buttons (exactly one per pop can rack);
    * and
    *   - two indicator lights: one to indicate that exact change should be used by
    * the user; the other to indicate that the machine is out of order.
    *
    * The component devices are interconnected as follows:
    * 
    *   - the output of the coin slot is connected to the input of the coin
    * receptacle;
    *   - the outputs of the coin receptacle are connected to the inputs of the
    * coin racks (for valid coins to be stored therein), the delivery chute (for
    * invalid coins or other coins to be returned), and the storage bin (for coins
    * to be accepted that do not fit in the coin racks);
    *   - the output of each coin rack is connected to the delivery chute; and
    *   - the output of each pop can rack is connected to the delivery chute.
    * 
    * 
    * Each component device can be disabled to prevent any physical movements.
    * Other functionality is not affected by disabling a device; hence devices that
    * do not involve physical movements are not affected by "disabling" them.
    * 
    * Most component devices have some sort of maximum capacity (e.g., of the
    * number of pop cans that can be stored therein). In some cases, this is a
    * simplification of the physical reality for the sake of simulation.
